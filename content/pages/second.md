## 一、Introduction

REPL stands for **Read-Eval-Print Loop**. It's a simple but powerful interactive programming environment commonly found in programming languages. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Read:** The REPL accepts input from the user. This input can be a single line of code, a block of code, or even an expression.
2. **Eval:** The REPL evaluates the user's input. This means it interprets the code and executes it.
3. **Print:** The REPL prints the result of the evaluation to the user. This could be a value, an error message, or any other output generated by the code.
4. **Loop:** The REPL returns to step 1, waiting for the user to enter another line of code. This creates a continuous cycle of reading, evaluating, printing, and looping back for more input.


Here are some of the benefits of using a REPL:

- **Experimentation:** It allows you to quickly try out code snippets and see the results immediately. This is a great way to learn new syntax, test functions, and experiment with different approaches to solve a problem.
- **Interactive learning:** REPLs are fantastic tools for learning new programming languages. You can get immediate feedback on your code, which helps you solidify your understanding of the language's concepts.
- **Debugging:** You can use a REPL to step through your code line by line, examining the values of variables at each stage. This can be helpful in identifying and fixing bugs in your programs.
